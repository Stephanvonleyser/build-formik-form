# Build Formik Form

This is a simple implementation of a Formik form. In this activity, the task was to create a login form with validation using Formik.

The form should include the following:

Email field
Password field
Submit button
The form should implement the following input validation rules:

If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.
