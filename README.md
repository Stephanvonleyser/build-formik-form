# Build Formik Form

This is a simple implementation of a Formik form. In this activity, the task was to create a login form with validation using Formik.

The form should include the following:

## Form Elements
- Email field
- Password field
- Submit button

## Input Validation Rules
The form should implement the following input validation rules:

- If the email or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the respective text input.
- If the email is not in the correct email format, display the message "Email should be in a valid format" under the email input.
- If the email and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.
